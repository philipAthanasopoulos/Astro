**Searchio**


<h1>About the project</h1>
This is a search engine application build to retrieve scientific articles. Users can enter keywords, authors, dates, etc to get relevant results from a big database of scientific articles.
The search engine is implemented using the Lucene library and JavaFX on the frontend view.



<h1>The Dataset</h1>
The project uses the "All NeurIPS (NIPS) Papers" dataset which can be found at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rowhitswami/nips-papers-1987-2019-updated/data?select=papers.csv). It consists of <b>9680</b> unique articles on the topic of <b>Neural Information Processing Systems</b>. Each dataset entry contains a year of publication, title, author details, abstracts and full text. These fields will be used to better determine the preferred articles to present to the user based on their search.
